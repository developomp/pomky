# Pomky

[![what's this?](https://img.shields.io/badge/what's_this%3F-grey?style=for-the-badge)](https://developomp.com/portfolio/pomky)

A conky-like system monitor made for the sole purpose of teaching myself rust-lang.

It is not as configurable, modular, or feature packed as conky. It is tailored for my need and hardware.<br />
If you're looking for an conky alternative written in rust, check out [iphands/randy](https://github.com/iphands/randy).
