# Pomky

A conky-like system monitor made for the sole purpose of teaching myself rust-lang.

It is not as configurable, modular, or feature packed as conky. It is tailored for my need and hardware.<br />
If you're looking for an conky alternative written in rust, check out [iphands/randy](https://github.com/iphands/randy).

Designed using [glade](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Glade).
